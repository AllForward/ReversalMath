The total distance travelled downstream in 12 minutes is 3.6 km. What is the speed of the boat in still water?", "explanation": "The total distance travelled downstream is a sum of the distance travelled by boat and the distance covered by the current. Since the total distance covered is given as 3.6 km, and the time is given as 12 minutes, we can find the combined speed first. \n\nWe should note that the speed of the boat plus the speed of the current will be their combined speed. Also, as 1 hour has 60 minutes, the time of 12 minutes equals 12/60 = 0.2 hours. \n\nSo the combined speed = total distance / time = 3.6 / 0.2 = 18 km/hr. \n\nAs we know the current speed is 3 km/hr, the speed of the boat in still water will be the combined speed minus the speed of the current, which is 18 - 3 = 15 km/hr.

If last week the bus driver earned $948 in total compensation and worked 51 hours, what is the maximum number of hours he can work per week at his regular rate?", "explanation": "The overtime rate is 75% higher than the regular rate. This means the overtime rate is $16 * 1.75 = $28 per hour. If the bus driver worked 51 hours and earned a total of $948, we can write a linear equation in two variables where one variable is the hours worked at regular rate (r) and the other variable is the hours worked at overtime (o). The total hours worked is r + o and the total compensation is $16r + $28o.\n\nWe know that r + o = 51 (since total hours worked is 51) and $16r + $28o = $948 (since total compensation is $948).\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 16 to get $16r + $16o = $816, then subtract this from the total compensation to get $12o = $132. Thus, the overtime hours (o) = $132/$12 = 11. \n\nThen, we can substitute o = 11 into r + o = 51 to get r = 51 - 11 = 40. \n\nSo, the maximum number of hours he can work per week at his regular rate is 40.

{"id": "5579e5dcbc5d11eebae6f7bf54c3034d", "answer": "600", "question": "A train that is 600 meters long will take a certain amount of seconds to cross a man walking with a speed of 3 km/hr in the direction of the moving train. The train is moving at a speed of 63 km/hr. If it takes the train 700 seconds to cross the man, what is the length of the train?", "explanation": "The train is moving at a speed of 63 km/hr. The man is walking at a speed of 3 km/hr. Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (63 - 3) km/hr = 60 km/hr. We need to convert this speed from km/hr to m/s by multiplying by 5/18, so the relative speed is 60 * (5/18) = 16.67 m/s. \n\nIf the train takes 700 seconds to cross the man, the length of the train can be calculated as time*speed, which amounts to 700 * 16.67 = 11669 meters. However, we know the train is 600 meters long.\n\nThis discrepancy could be due to a misinterpretation of the question or an error in the provided information, as the question assumes the train covers its own length in addition to the distance it covers while crossing the man walking. In realistic terms, when a train crosses a person, it actually covers only its own length, since the person walking hardly adds any significant distance.\n\nSo, the length of the train is still 600 meters regardless of how long it takes to cross the man. If the question intended to ask for the distance the train travelled while crossing the man, then my reasoning above shows it travelled 11669 meters.\n\nBut to answer your question specifically, the length of the train remains as provided.

If we want to calculate the speed of the man in km/hr, we need to convert the length of the train from meters to kilometers, and the time from seconds to hours. \n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the speed of the man relative to the speed of the train. The length of the train is 250 meters, which converts to 250/1000=0.25 kilometers. The time is 20 seconds, which is 20/3600=0.00556 hours approximately. \n\nThe relative speed of the man to the train when they go in the same direction is distance/time = 0.25 km/0.00556 hr \u2248 45 km / hr.\n\nThe speed of the man is the speed of the train minus the relative speed, which is 55 km/hr - 45 km/hr = 10 km/hr.

Thus, we can set up the equation: 34.2% of total number of candidates equals sum of passed boys and passed girls. let's denote the number of girls as G, then we can solve the equation: 0.342 * 2000 = 0.36 * (2000 - G) + 0.32 * G, it simplifies to 684 = 720 - 0.36G + 0.32G, which gives 0.04G = 36, and finally, we can find G = 36/0.04 = 900.

He bought 5 shirts, and the cost of a shirt is $20 less than that of a trouser. Given that he bought a total of 16 items, how many of those were shirts?", "explanation": "The total cost of shirts and trousers is $700. Given that John paid $400 less for the shirts, the cost of the trousers was $X and that of the shirts was $X - $400. So we get $X + ($X - $400) = $700, which simplifies to 2X = $1100. Solving for X gives X = $550, which is the cost of the trousers. Therefore the cost of the shirts is $550 - $400 = $150.\n\nGiven that he bought 5 shirts at a cost of $150, this means the cost of a single shirt is $150 / 5 = $30. Also given that the cost of a shirt is $20 less than that of a trouser, this means the cost of a trouser is $30 + $20 = $50.\n\nSince the cost of the trousers is $550, this implies John bought $550 / $50 = 11 trousers.\n\nFinally given that John bought a total of 16 items, and we know 11 of them were trousers, this implies he bought 16 - 11 = 5 shirts.

Let the value of \"E\" be x.\n\nThe sum of the values of the letters is 8 + x + 14. The length of the word \"hen\" is 3. So the number value of the word is (8 + x + 14) * 3 = 81. \n\nSolving for x gives us the equation (8 + x + 14) * 3 = 81. Simplifying, we get (22 + x) * 3 = 81.

The average speed for both the trips is 86 km/h. What speed did the person travel with from point A to point B?", "explanation": "this question is a bit tricky because it involves understanding how average speed works. the question states that going from point a to point b, the person travels at a certain speed. we'll call this speed x. when they return, they increase this speed by 15%. this could be represented as x * 1.15 (or x + 0.15x). \n\nthe average speed of the two trips is given as 86 km/h. the average speed of any two speeds is simply the total distance divided by the total time. in this case, the distance traveled is the same both ways. so the average speed is just the total of the two speeds divided by 2. so (x + x * 1.15) / 2 = 86.\n\nsolving this equation for x, we get x = (86 * 2) / (1 + 1.15) = 172 / 2.15, which roughly equals to 80 km/h. therefore, the person travelled with a speed of 80 km/h from point a to point b.
