How long would that take? 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 minutes. Is that it? No. That would make this question too simple even as a warm up question. Let's brainstorm a little further. To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together. If they cross together, then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. Ahaa, we are getting closer. The fastest way to get 1 across and be back is to use 2 to usher 1 across. So let's put all this together. 1 and 2 go cross 2 comes back 7 and 10 go across 1 comes back 1 and 2 go across (done) Total time = 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 minutes", "wrong": "", "wrong_explanation": ""}

For every additional 20 samosas, the price of the whole lot goes down by 10 paise per samosa. What should be the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue?", "explanation": "Number of samosas = 200 + 20n, where n is a natural number. Price per samosa = Rs( 2 - 0.1n) .

How long would it take for Lisa to paint a house of the same size by herself?", "explanation": "Here, the rate equation becomes: (# of houses) = (painting rate) x (time) When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. Thus, (1 house) = (Mary\u2019s rate) x (4 hr), so her rate is 1/4. When Mary & Lisa paint together, it takes 3 hrs. Thus, (1 house) = (combined rate) x (3 hr) and the combined rate = 1/3.

(combined rate) = (Mary\u2019s rate) + (Lisa\u2019s rate) 1/3 = 1/4 + (Lisa\u2019s rate) (Lisa\u2019s rate) = 1/3-1/4=1/3*4/4-1/4*3/3=4/12-3/12=1/12 Lisa\u2019s rate is 1/12 of a house every hour, or in other words, 1 house in 12 hrs.

Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1). Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600. tan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3 So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3. 10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3) h can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3). To travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes : h = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3) h / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?", "explanation": "Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35. => x/7 + y/9 = 35. => 9x + 7y = (35)(63) => 7y = (35)(63) - 9x => y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x => y = 315 - (9/7)x => x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values, x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153 x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144 x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135 x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126 As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs.

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books?

In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes). At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 \u2013 n) without a calculator. Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 \u2013 n) suggests n can not be less than 10.) As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer. Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D", "wrong": "", "wrong_explanation": ""}

If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes. The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence T = 13 X = 7 Y Hence 13 X = 7 Y Solve the above for X X = 7 Y / 13 We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13.

Let a = kp, where both k and p are positive integers. Thus, Q = (kp)4=k4\u2217p4(kp)4=k4\u2217p4. Now the number of factors of Q = (4+1)*(4+1) = 25. But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors, thus \"a\" can't have any other factor except 1 and itself. Thus, a = prime number. Statement I :We can represent Q = (a^2)^2. Thus, we have to prove whether a^2 is a prime number. Take a=2. We can see that it is not a prime number.
